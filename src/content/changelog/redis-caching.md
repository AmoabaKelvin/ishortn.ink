title: Redis Caching for Faster Link Redirection

We have added Redis caching to iShortn to make link redirection faster. Redis is an in-memory data store that can be used as a cache. It is used to store the most frequently accessed data in memory, which makes it faster to access.

Adding this layer saw a massive improvement in the speed of link redirection 🚀. This means that when a user clicks on a short link, the link will redirect to the destination URL faster than before. This will also save us some dollars 💸 and prolong our free-tier usage of some services 😁
