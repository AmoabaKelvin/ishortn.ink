QR codes just got a major upgrade. You can now customize every aspect of your QR code's appearance—from pixel shapes and marker styles to visual effects and color schemes. Plus, save your favorite styles as presets for instant reuse.

## What's new?

The QR code creation page now includes a powerful styling panel with three main sections:

### Shape customization

Control the fundamental look of your QR code with these options:

- **Pixel Style** — Choose from square, rounded, dot, squircle, row, or column patterns
- **Marker Shape** — Style the three corner markers with square, circle, plus, box, octagon, or random shapes
- **Inner Shape** — Customize the center of markers with auto, square, circle, plus, diamond, or eye styles

### Color options

Make your QR codes match your brand:

- **QR Code Color** — Pick from preset colors or enter any custom hex value
- **Background Color** — Set the background to white, light gray, dark, or any color you need

### Visual effects

Add distinctive touches to make your QR codes stand out:

- **Crystalize** — Applies a geometric, faceted look using Delaunay triangulation
- **Liquidify** — Creates a smooth, fluid appearance with blur-based processing
- **Effect Intensity** — Fine-tune how strong the effect appears (5-30 range)
- **Margin Noise** — Add decorative dots around the QR code border with adjustable density

## Style presets

Save time by storing your favorite configurations:

1. **Create a preset** — Style your QR code, click "Save Current Style", and give it a name
2. **Apply a preset** — Click any saved preset to instantly load its settings
3. **Update presets** — Modify the style and update the preset when you see changes
4. **Delete presets** — Remove presets you no longer need with one click

Presets save all styling options: pixel style, marker shapes, colors, effects, and margin noise settings. They're perfect for maintaining brand consistency across multiple QR codes or quickly switching between campaign styles.

## Live preview

Every change you make updates the QR code preview in real-time. What you see is exactly what you'll get when you generate the final code.
