shortDesc: Control which team members can access specific folders and their links

Team owners and admins can now restrict folder access to specific team members. When a folder is restricted, only permitted members can see the folder and its links on the dashboard.

## How it works

By default, all folders are accessible to every team member. You can restrict access to specific members using the new folder settings:

1. **Open folder settings** — Click the gear icon on any folder card (visible to owners/admins only)
2. **Choose access level** — Select "All members" for full team access, or "Restricted" to limit access
3. **Select members** — When restricted, choose which team members can view the folder
4. **Save** — Changes take effect immediately

## What gets restricted

When you restrict a folder:

- **Folder visibility** — Only permitted members see the folder in the folders list
- **Link visibility** — Links inside the folder are hidden from the dashboard for non-permitted members
- **Direct access blocked** — Non-permitted members cannot view, edit, or delete links in restricted folders

## Who can manage permissions

Only team **owners** and **admins** can configure folder permissions. They also always have access to all folders, regardless of restrictions.

## Visual indicators

Owners and admins will see a "Restricted" badge on folders that have access limitations. This helps quickly identify which folders have custom permissions configured.

## Unfoldered links

Links that aren't in any folder remain visible to all team members. Only links inside restricted folders are hidden from non-permitted members.

## Who can use this?

Folder permissions are available to all team workspaces. If you're using a personal workspace, you won't see the folder settings option since there are no team members to restrict.

Configure folder access from the folders page at [/dashboard/folders](/dashboard/folders).
