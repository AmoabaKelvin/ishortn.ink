Team workspaces are here. Ultra plan users can now create teams, invite members, and manage shared links, folders, and domains—all in one place.

## What are team workspaces?

A team workspace is a separate environment where multiple users can collaborate on the same set of links, folders, QR codes, and custom domains. Each team gets its own subdomain (e.g., `your-team.ishortn.ink`) and operates independently from your personal workspace.

## Creating a team

If you're on the Ultra plan, you can create a team from the workspace switcher in the sidebar:

1. **Open the workspace switcher** — Click your workspace name in the sidebar
2. **Click "Create Team"** — Enter a name and slug for your team
3. **Start inviting members** — Add your colleagues via email

Your team workspace is ready to use immediately after creation.

## Switching between workspaces

The workspace switcher in the sidebar lets you move between your personal workspace and any teams you belong to. Each workspace has its own:

- Links and short URLs
- Folders for organization
- QR codes
- Custom domains
- UTM templates
- Tags

Resources in one workspace are completely separate from another.

## Team roles and permissions

Every team member has a role that determines what they can do:

- **Owner** — Full control over the team, including billing, settings, and member management
- **Admin** — Can manage members and invites, and access all team resources
- **Member** — Can create and manage links, folders, and QR codes

## Inviting team members

Team owners and admins can invite new members:

1. **Go to team settings** — Navigate to your team's members page
2. **Send an invite** — Enter the email address and select a role
3. **They accept** — The invitee receives an email with a link to join

Invites expire after 7 days. You can resend or revoke pending invites at any time.

## Who can use this?

Team workspaces are available exclusively to Ultra plan subscribers. If you're on a Free or Pro plan, upgrade to Ultra to unlock team collaboration.

Manage your team at [/dashboard/teams/settings](/dashboard/teams/settings) once you've created one.
