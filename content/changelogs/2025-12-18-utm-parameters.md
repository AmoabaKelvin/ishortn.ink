We're excited to introduce UTM parameter support, making it easier than ever to track the performance of your marketing campaigns directly within iShortn.

## What are UTM parameters?

UTM parameters are tags you add to URLs to track where your traffic comes from. When someone clicks a link with UTM parameters, those tags are sent to your analytics platform, helping you understand which campaigns, sources, and content drive the most engagement.

## Adding UTM parameters to links

You can now add UTM parameters directly when creating or editing any link:

- **utm_source** — Identify where your traffic comes from (e.g., `google`, `newsletter`, `twitter`)
- **utm_medium** — Track the marketing medium (e.g., `cpc`, `email`, `social`)
- **utm_campaign** — Name your campaign for easy identification (e.g., `spring_sale`, `product_launch`)
- **utm_term** — Track paid search keywords
- **utm_content** — Differentiate between similar content or links in the same ad

When you shorten a link with UTM parameters, they're automatically appended to your destination URL when visitors click through.

## How to use it

1. **Create or edit a link** — Go to your dashboard and create a new link or edit an existing one
2. **Expand UTM Parameters** — Click the "UTM Parameters" section to reveal the fields
3. **Fill in your parameters** — Add the relevant UTM values for your campaign
4. **Save** — Your link is now ready to track campaign performance

## Why this matters

With UTM parameters built directly into iShortn, you no longer need to manually construct tracking URLs or use separate UTM builders. Everything is integrated into your link management workflow, making campaign tracking seamless and error-free.

Combined with our existing analytics, you'll have a complete picture of how your shortened links perform across different marketing channels.

## UTM Templates

We've also added **UTM Templates** to supercharge your workflow:

- **Save time** — Create reusable templates for campaigns you run regularly
- **Stay consistent** — Ensure your team uses the same UTM conventions across all links
- **Quick apply** — Select a template when creating links to instantly fill in all UTM fields

Manage your templates at [/dashboard/utm-templates](/dashboard/utm-templates). Create templates for your most common campaigns like email newsletters, social media posts, or paid advertising, and apply them with a single click.
