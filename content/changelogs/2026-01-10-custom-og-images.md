title: Custom Social Media Previews
shortDesc: Upload custom images and set your own title and description for link previews
category: feature
---

Take control of how your links appear when shared on social media. You can now upload custom images and set your own titles and descriptions—making every link share look exactly how you want it.

## What's new?

When you create or edit a link, you'll find a new "Custom Social Media Previews" section. This lets you override the default metadata that social platforms like Twitter, Facebook, LinkedIn, and WhatsApp display when someone shares your link.

### Custom metadata options

- **Custom Title** — Set a specific headline for your link preview
- **Custom Description** — Write your own description text
- **Custom Image** — Upload an image or paste a URL

### Image upload

The new image uploader makes it easy to add custom preview images:

1. **Click to upload** — Select an image from your device
2. **Drag and drop** — Drop an image directly onto the upload area
3. **Paste a URL** — Use an existing image URL if you prefer
4. **Preview** — See exactly how your image will appear before saving

Supported formats include PNG, JPG, GIF, and WebP. Images are stored securely and served from our CDN for fast loading on all platforms.

## Why this matters

When you share a short link without custom metadata, social platforms typically show the destination page's preview—which might not represent your brand or campaign. With custom previews, you control the narrative:

- **Brand consistency** — Use your own branded images instead of random page screenshots
- **Campaign messaging** — Write compelling titles and descriptions that drive clicks
- **A/B testing** — Try different preview images to see what performs best
- **Clean appearance** — Avoid broken or missing previews from pages with poor metadata

## How it works

When a social media crawler (like Twitter's or Facebook's) visits your short link, we serve your custom metadata instead of redirecting. The crawler sees your custom title, description, and image—then displays that preview when someone shares the link.

Regular users still get redirected instantly to the destination URL. The custom metadata only affects how the link appears in previews.

## Editing existing links

Already have links you want to update? Open the edit drawer for any link and you'll find the same "Custom Social Media Previews" section. Update the metadata anytime—changes take effect immediately.

## Who can use this?

Custom social media previews are available to **Pro** and **Ultra** subscribers. Start customizing your link previews when [creating a new link](/dashboard/link/new) or editing an existing one.
